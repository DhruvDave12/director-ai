# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification
The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot
screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM
response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- Always check regex match() results for null before accessing array indices - use optional chaining or explicit null checks
- Use 'let' instead of 'const' for variables that need reassignment, especially in conditional blocks
- When extracting URLs, use comprehensive regex patterns and provide fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- Successfully patched @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to extend DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MSEC from 60000ms to 6000000ms using patch-package
- patch-package with postinstall scripts is the reliable method for maintaining npm package patches across installs

## Agent Creation Process (agent-server/)

### Understanding Agent Registration System
The agent-server uses a factory pattern with registry for managing agents:

1. **Base Agent Structure**: All agents extend `BaseAgent` class from `src/types/agent.ts`
2. **Agent Factory**: Registry system in `src/core/agent-factory.ts` manages agent creation
3. **Registration**: Agents are registered in `src/index.ts` in `initializeAgents()` function

### Agent Creation Steps

#### Step 1: Create Agent Class
Create new agent in `src/agents/main/[agent-name].ts`:
```typescript
import type { AgentConfig, AgentRequest, AgentResponse, AgentExecutionContext } from "../../types/agent.js";
import { BaseAgent } from "../../types/agent.js";

export class YourAgentClass extends BaseAgent {
  constructor() {
    const config: AgentConfig = {
      id: "your_agent_id", // Must be unique
      name: "Your Agent Name",
      description: "Agent description",
      version: "1.0.0",
      capabilities: ["capability1", "capability2"],
      metadata: { /* agent-specific config */ },
    };
    super(config);
  }

  async execute(request: AgentRequest, context: AgentExecutionContext): Promise<AgentResponse> {
    // Implementation logic
  }

  async healthCheck(): Promise<boolean> {
    // Health check logic
  }
}

export const createYourAgent = (): BaseAgent => new YourAgentClass();
```

#### Step 2: Register Agent in Main Index
Update `src/index.ts`:
1. Import the factory function
2. Register in `initializeAgents()` function
3. Create default instance

#### Step 3: Reusable Utilities
- Use `src/utils/gemini-util.ts` for Gemini AI interactions
- Create shared utilities in `src/utils/` for common functionality
- Follow singleton pattern for stateless utilities

### Key Patterns
- **Payload Handling**: Agents receive payload as string (like web scraper)
- **Error Handling**: Always return structured AgentResponse with success/error
- **Metadata**: Include processing time, content length, request IDs
- **Health Checks**: Implement meaningful health checks for external dependencies
- **Factory Pattern**: Export factory function for registry registration

### SEO Optimization Agent Example
- Created `seo-optimization-agent.ts` following the pattern
- Uses `geminiUtil` for AI-powered SEO analysis
- Takes same payload format as web scraper (string input)
- Provides comprehensive SEO recommendations with structured output

### GitHub Agent Example
- Created `github-agent.ts` following the pattern
- **Simplified to SEO-only agent**: Takes string payload containing SEO context with embedded GitHub repo URL
- **Payload Format**: String input (no JSON parsing) containing SEO context and repository URL
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Extracts repository URL from context using regex patterns
  - Uses Gemini AI to generate complete SEO-optimized HTML from context
  - Creates unique branch names with format: `director-ai-{UUID}`
  - Commits optimized HTML to new branch and creates PR
  - Returns simple "Action completed check on github" message
- **Repository URL Detection**: Supports both `github.com/owner/repo` and direct `owner/repo` patterns
- **AI-Powered HTML Generation**: Creates complete HTML5 documents with comprehensive SEO elements
- Uses Octokit for GitHub API interactions and Gemini for AI-powered HTML generation

### Dependencies
- `@google/genai` for Gemini AI integration
- `@octokit/rest` for GitHub API operations
- `dotenv` for environment variable management
- Ensure GOOGLE_API_KEY and GITHUB_TOKEN are configured in environment

## Current Task: Add Dynamic Blockchain Chain Configuration

### Task Description
Add BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN environment variable to all three applications (backend, agent-server, frontend) to allow dynamic selection between base-sepolia and polygon-amoy chains:
- Add environment variable to configure chain selection
- Update agent-pay-handler.ts to use dynamic chain
- Update agent-payer.service.js to use dynamic chain  
- Update frontend config/index.tsx to use dynamic chain
- Update frontend context/index.tsx to use dynamic chain
- Ensure all chain references are consistent across the application stack

### Task Progress
[X] Add BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN environment variable to all three applications
[X] Update agent-pay-handler.ts to use dynamic chain from environment
[X] Update agent-payer.service.js to use dynamic chain from environment
[X] Update frontend config/index.tsx to use dynamic chain from environment
[X] Update frontend context/index.tsx to use dynamic chain from environment
[X] Test that chain switching works across all components

### Implementation Details

#### Current Hardcoded References
- agent-server/src/handler/agent-pay-handler.ts: Line 25 - "base-sepolia" hardcoded in recipient
- backend/src/services/agent-payer.service.js: Line 34 - "base-sepolia" hardcoded in createSigner call
- frontend/src/config/index.tsx: Line 12 - networks = [baseSepolia] hardcoded
- frontend/src/context/index.tsx: Lines 29-30 - baseSepolia hardcoded in networks and defaultNetwork

#### Chain Mapping Strategy
Environment Variable: BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN (values: "base-sepolia" | "polygon-amoy")
- Default to "base-sepolia" if not set
- Map to appropriate network configurations in each application
- Frontend: Map to wagmi network objects (baseSepolia, polygonAmoy)
- Backend/Agent: Use string values for API calls and configurations

#### Files to be Modified
- backend/.env.example + backend/.env (create/update)
- agent-server/.env.example + agent-server/.env (create/update)
- frontend/.env.example + frontend/.env.local (create/update)
- agent-server/src/handler/agent-pay-handler.ts
- backend/src/services/agent-payer.service.js
- frontend/src/config/index.tsx
- frontend/src/context/index.tsx

### Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Summary:** Successfully implemented dynamic blockchain chain configuration across all three applications (backend, agent-server, frontend). The system now supports switching between base-sepolia and polygon-amoy networks using environment variables:

- **Backend**: Uses `BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN` environment variable
- **Agent-Server**: Uses `BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN` environment variable  
- **Frontend**: Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN` environment variable

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Environment-based chain selection with validation
- Dynamic network configuration for wallet connections
- Proper error handling and fallback to default values
- Consistent chain usage across payment processing, agent handling, and UI
- Test verification confirming functionality works correctly

**Files Modified:**
- Created `.env.example` files in all three applications
- Updated `agent-server/src/handler/agent-pay-handler.ts` with dynamic chain support
- Updated `backend/src/services/agent-payer.service.js` with environment-based configuration
- Updated `frontend/src/config/index.tsx` with dynamic network selection
- Updated `frontend/src/context/index.tsx` to use dynamic network configuration

**Next Steps for Users:**
1. Copy `.env.example` files to `.env` in each application directory
2. Set `BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN="base-sepolia"` or `BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN="polygon-amoy"` in backend and agent-server
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN="base-sepolia"` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_CHAIN="polygon-amoy"` in frontend
4. Restart all services after changing environment variables
